    <div class="intro">
      <p>We teamed up with organisations to see how digital technologies could transform their products and services, and helped them invent new ones.</p>
      <p>We did this through workshops, prototyping, research and making things.</p>
      <p>We’ve <a href="/case-studies/bulletin">prototyped new products</a>, <a href="/case-studies/improving-care">investigated technology policy</a>, <a href="/browserprototyping">taught people new digital skills</a> and <a href="/projects">more</a>.</p>
