description: Weâ€™re a small design studio focused on designing interactions and developing new products. We think through making and use early prototyping and material exploration to feed our ideas.

    <p>Our focus on making as part of the design process means we work in a highly collaborative way with our clients. We often join their existing multidisciplinary teams.</p>

    <p>No two projects are the same, and we design our approach depending on the brief.</p>

    <h3>Services</h3>

    <h4>Research</h4>
    <p>Our research consist of workshops, prototyping, or other kinds of research, depending what kinds of knowledge we need. We summarise our findings in an accessible format, usually as short presentations.</p>

    <h4>Design</h4>
    <p>We help our clients develop new products and improve existing ones. Our ideas quickly become prototypes, letting our experimentation inform our approach. Depending on the brief we deliver prototypes, presentations, innovation workshops, and software / hardware products.</p>
    <p>Read how we found ways to improve <a href="/projects/improving-care/">end of life care in the NHS</a> through prototyping.</p>

    <h4>Education and training</h4>
    <p>We deliver educational workshops for design students and small teams, helping them understand design techniques or specific technologies and how to work with them.</p>
    <p>Find out more about the <a href="/browserprototyping">Browser Prototyping</a> workshop, which we ran at various universities and companies of all sizes.</p>
