description: We were a small design studio focused on designing interactions and developing new products. We thought through making and used early prototyping and material exploration to feed our ideas.

    <p>Our focus on making as part of the design process meant we worked in a highly collaborative way with our clients. We often joined their existing multidisciplinary teams.</p>

    <p>No two projects were the same, and we designed our approach depending on the brief.</p>

    <h3>Services we used to provide</h3>

    <h4>Research</h4>
    <p>Our research consisted of workshops, prototyping, or other kinds of research, depending what kinds of knowledge we needed. We summarised our findings in an accessible format, usually as short presentations.</p>

    <h4>Design</h4>
    <p>We helped our clients develop new products and improve existing ones. Our ideas quickly became prototypes, letting our experimentation inform our approach. Depending on the brief weâ€™d deliver prototypes, presentations, innovation workshops, and software / hardware products.</p>
    <p>Read how we found ways to improve <a href="/projects/improving-care/">end of life care in the NHS</a> through prototyping.</p>

    <h4>Education and training</h4>
    <p>We delivered educational workshops for design students and small teams, helping them understand design techniques or specific technologies and how to work with them.</p>
