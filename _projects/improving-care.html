    <p>We joined Doteveryone for four months to help them explore how they could incorporate prototyping into their work. Our work centred on a project to see how technology could improve end of life care.</p>

    <p>We built several prototypes that helped us explore the challenge of transforming health services. Instead of testing possible solutions, or proposing new products, these prototypes were used to take different approaches to problem solving. A print-on-demand tool helped us uncover the need for better connectivity in care homes, while testing a smart fridge interface helped us prove the value of standardised datasets.</p>

    <p>Our prototypes fed into Doteveryoneâ€™s <a href="https://projects.doteveryone.org.uk/improvingcare/">report about Improving Care</a>, a white paper proposing key changes to the health and care system in the UK.</p>
