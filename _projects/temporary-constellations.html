    <p>We visualised the ad-hoc constellations formed by different clusters of navigation satellites on Christmas Day around the world.</p>

    <p>Each Temporary Constellation is formed from individual GPS satellites and the more recent rival positioning systems GLONASS, Galileo and BeiDou, memorialised as a Christmas card.</p>

    <p>These constellations only last a single moment in time, and then theyâ€™re gone.</p>
