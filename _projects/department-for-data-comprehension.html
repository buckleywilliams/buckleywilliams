    <p>We developed a short workshop on working with data as a material, and run it at the <a href="http://mif.co.uk">MIF</a> for young creative practitioners coming from a variety of disciplines.</p>

    <p>The task for the participants was to help develop a greater body of knowledge about Manchester. They had to decide what data should be collected, why, how to collect it, analyze it and how to communicate it to the world. Through making these decisions they got to experience data not as something cold and objective, but as a malleable tool for storytelling.</p>
